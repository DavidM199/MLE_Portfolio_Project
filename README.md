# MLE_Portfolio_Project

This project is to finish the course `Machine Learning/AI Engineer Career Path` on [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and to showcase what I have learned by implementing some concepts and creating clean and reproducible code.

Dataset: 
I took the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn?resource=download) and it is a dataset showing `Telco Customer Churn`. In the following project I will create machine learning implementations to figure out which models perform best and which features are most predictive of a customer churning.

This type of analysis could be of great help to businesses, as it attacks the problem of trend detection and future readiness.
